/**
 * app.js — the Calculator tab.
 *
 * Layout (astrogem-grader house style: the control deck, then results):
 *   DECK       the character + bracelet controls. NOT built here any more —
 *              profile.js owns them, and this file mounts them (see below).
 *   PROFILE    the imported character's header: ★, class icon, name, cache pill
 *              and chips. Hidden until a character is imported.
 *   BRACELET   one row per granted slot — family picker (grouped and priced),
 *              tier, and a value box for the basic-stat families. All rows empty
 *              means an unrolled bracelet, which is the default.
 *   RESULTS    the headline cards and the per-line breakdown. WHAT TO DO about
 *              the bracelet — the lock advice, the spread, the keep-or-replace
 *              cut — is the Advisor tab's, and so is the code that draws it.
 *
 * THE STATE IS NOT HERE (since 2026-08-11). window.Profile owns it, persists it
 * and renders the control deck; this file holds the LIVE state object it returns,
 * mounts the deck into the Calculator pane, and re-solves whenever Profile says
 * something moved. The Tier List mounts the same deck, which is the whole point of
 * the split: one slider, every tab.
 *
 * THE MATH IS NOT HERE either. Every number comes from window.Bracelet
 * (model/bracelet.js), which this file only ever reads:
 *   Bracelet.solve({grade, profile, fixedLines, grantedLines, slots, rollsLeft, …})
 *   Bracelet.lineDamage / lineInfo / damagePercent / deriveBaseline / attackPower
 *
 * WHY A WORKER. A three-slot, seven-roll solve is ~48,000 states and ~3 s. Run
 * on the main thread it freezes the page on every keystroke, so solve() lives in
 * solver-worker.js: one request in flight, later requests queued and collapsed,
 * stale answers dropped by id, results cached by a canonical state key. Input
 * changes are debounced ~300 ms. That worker is SHARED — the Advisor rides this
 * file's solver through window.BraceletApp, because advise() answers off the one
 * DP context the worker is holding. Gold never enters the key: worth is a sum
 * over the distribution the solve returns, recomputed here for free.

   * WHAT A BRACELET IS WORTH, in gold. The model's own definition, applied to the
   * distribution the solver just returned:
   *
   *     E[ max(0, final% - baseline%) ] x gold per 1%
   *
   * You are paid only by the outcomes that BEAT the bracelet you would wear
   * instead, weighted by how often they happen and by how far they clear it. So
   * the figure is never negative: a bracelet you would not equip is worth
   * nothing, not a debt.
   *
   * It used to be (expectedFinal - baseline) x gold — a difference of means,
   * which goes negative the moment the baseline outruns the bracelet, and which
   * compared a LOG-SPACE score against a damage percentage, mixing units on top
   * (Shizu, 2026-08-11). Both halves of that are gone.
   *
   * Why the arithmetic is here and not read off res.valueGold: the solve is run
   * with goldPer1Pct 0 and baselinePct 0 on purpose (see solveState), because
   * keeping gold out of the cache key is what lets the gold slider drag without
   * a three-second re-solve. The worker's own valueGold is therefore always 0.
   * The distribution is the expensive part; this is the cheap sum over it.
   *
   * The cdf arrives THINNED to ~400 rungs, so each rung stands for the whole
   * interval below it — take that interval's MIDPOINT rather than its top end,
   * or the answer prices several percent high.
   *
   * `shiftD` moves every outcome by a constant log-space offset: how the
   * unrolled card reprices one solved distribution at a different combat-trait
   * total.
   *
   * ONE IMPLEMENTATION, and this is it (Shizu, 2026-08-15). The Advisor used to
   * carry a second reading of the same formula for its per-lock rows — same
   * intent, different treatment of the interval the bar lands inside — and the
   * two disagreed on screen: 868k in the card over 876k in the row beneath it,
   * 17% against 17.4%. The per-mask rows now call this through
   * BraceletApp.worth.fromCdf with their own cdf, so a disagreement is not
   * something the code can express any more.
   *
   * Returns, for the distribution and the bar it is given:
   *   gold  E[max(0, final% - bar)] x gold per 1%
   *   p     P(final% > bar)
   *   mean  E[final% | final% > bar] — where it lands in the runs that clear it
   * or null when there is no distribution to read.

   * The stand-in families a "Junk Line" pick resolves to, lightest listed
   * weight first. They are all specials, deliberately:
   *
   *   - Which one we pick cannot change a granted slot's answer. A junk line is
   *     never locked (the solver's allowLockJunk is off), so it is always
   *     rerolled away and never enters buildPool's present-family set or its
   *     per-category count. Solving the same bracelet with a junk trait, with
   *     Vitality and with a junk special returns bit-identical numbers.
   *   - The category still has to be plausible for the CAP check in
   *     validateSet, which a granted set does run. Specials cap at five, so
   *     three junk slots plus two fixed lines always fit; traits cap at TWO, so
   *     resolving junk to a trait would make three junk slots illegal.
   *   - All thirteen score zero for every profile, not just the default one, so
   *     "Junk Line" really is worth nothing to whoever is looking at it.
   *
   * This is exactly why the collapse stops at the granted slots. A FIXED line
   * never rerolls, so it DOES sit in the pool's present set and its category
   * count for good, and there the category matters a great deal: two fixed
   * combat traits close the whole 35% trait share of the pool, which a fixed
   * junk special does not (expected final 5.94% against 4.49%). The Advanced
   * fixed-line editor therefore still lists every family by name.
   *
   * NOT CACHED. Which families score nothing depends on the ROLE as much as on
   * the grade, and a cache keyed on the grade alone handed a support the damage
   * dealer's stand-ins: a row labelled "Junk Line — no damage at all" scored
   * +0.25% and +0.67% (Shizu, 2026-08-14). It is a sort over thirty families off
   * letters profile.js already caches, so there was nothing here worth keeping.

      "line scores sum, and D reads as roughly the percentage gain. The bracelet total converts back once, " +
      "<code>(e^(&Sigma;D/100) &minus; 1) &times; 100</code> &mdash; which is why the Total row lands a shade " +
      "under the sum of the column above it. Hover any figure in that table for the arithmetic behind it.</p>" +

      "<p><b>Current score</b> is what the bracelet on screen is worth against no bracelet at all: both fixed " +
      "combat traits and every effect line, on the character in the deck above. It moves when you change a " +
      "setting, because a line's worth depends on what you already carry &mdash; crit rate is worth nothing to " +
      "a build already at 100%.</p>" +

      "<p><b>Expected final</b> is where the bracelet lands after the remaining rolls, played perfectly. Rolls " +
      "cost silver, not gold, so the tool treats them as free; rolling then always beats stopping, and there is " +
      "no stop-or-carry-on question left to answer. Every outcome of every roll is enumerated and the recursion " +
      "solved backwards from the last roll &mdash; no simulation, so the figure is the model's exact " +
      "expectation. It is an average over every way the rolls can land, not a promise: half of all bracelets " +
      "finish below the median. The Advisor tab draws the whole spread.</p>" +

      "<p><b>Worth</b> is <code>E[max(0, final% &minus; baseline%)] &times; gold per 1%</code>. You are paid " +
      "only by the outcomes that beat the bracelet you would wear instead, weighted by how often they land and " +
      "by how far they clear it. So it is never negative: a bracelet you would not equip is worth nothing, not " +
      "a debt. Both inputs are yours &mdash; the gold rate and the baseline are the <b>Economy</b> pair at the " +
      "foot of the Grader panel, and an " +
      "import seeds them from the character's own bracelet.</p>" +

      "<p><b>LOCK and REROLL</b> beside a slot come from the solver's best set of locks. A lock is worth buying only " +
      "when the line it holds is scarcer than what a fresh draw would hand you, so the badge does not say this " +
      "line is good &mdash; it says keeping it beats rerolling it, over every roll you have left. One attempt " +
      "rerolls every unlocked slot at once, which is why the advice comes as a set and not slot by slot.</p>" +

      "<p><b>The unrolled price</b> answers what a sealed bracelet is worth to a buyer. The two combat traits " +
      "never reroll, so they are the one part of the bracelet a buyer cannot change: 120/120 and 80/80 at the " +
