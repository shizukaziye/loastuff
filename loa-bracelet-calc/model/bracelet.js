/**
 * bracelet.js — PURE deterministic core for the Lost Ark T4 bracelet model.
 *
 * No DOM, no I/O, no dependencies. Works as a browser <script> (attaches
 * window.Bracelet) and as a Node require() (CommonJS module.exports).
 *
 * ======================= WHAT THIS FILE CONTAINS =======================
 *
 *  1. SCORING      a line -> % damage gain for a character profile, in log
 *                  space (D = 100·ln(multiplier)), so line scores add up.
 *  2. POOL         the renormalised granted-roll distribution for a bracelet
 *                  that already carries a given set of lines.
 *  3. SOLVER       exact expectimax/DP over the reroll decision. No Monte
 *                  Carlo: every roll outcome is enumerated.
 *  4. DECODER      lostark.bible character-payload bracelet stats -> lines.
 *
 * ============================ SCORING MODEL ============================
 *
 * Damage in Lost Ark is multiplicative, so each line is scored
 *     D = 100 · ln(multiplier)          (≈ % damage gain, additive in log space)
 * and the exact combined figure is damagePercent(D) = (e^(D/100) − 1)·100. This
 * is the same convention as the accessory and astrogem calculators.
 *
 * A bracelet's score is NOT simply the sum of its lines. Four buckets are shared
 * by the whole item — crit (capped at 100%), the additional-damage pool, flat
 * weapon power and flat main stat — so the lines that feed one of them pool first
 * and the bucket is applied once. See "Contribution records"; setDamage() and the
 * solver both work that way, and lineDamage() still prices ONE line from the bare
 * profile, which is what the pickers and the family letters want.
 *
 * Character inputs (see DEFAULT_PROFILE) drive every number; no tier's damage
 * value is hardcoded.
 *
 *   Attack power   AP = sqrt(mainStatTotal × weaponPowerTotal / 6) · (1+baseApPct)
 *                  + flatAP, damage linear in AP. Bracelet flat stats are added
 *                  to the RAW stat and then amplified by the percentage buckets
 *                  (msPct / wpPct), so the gain is a full AP ratio; with
 *                  flatAP = 0 it collapses to the plain sqrt ratio.
 *                  deriveBaseline() turns a gear setup into those raw numbers.
 *                  flatWP — flat WEAPON power, from a weapon ark-grid core or an
 *                  accessory's "Weapon Power +480" roll — is weapon power, not
 *                  attack power: it joins weaponPowerRaw INSIDE the square root
 *                  and takes the wpPct bucket with it. Sitting beside flatAP
 *                  instead would be wrong by construction, and the 59 saved
 *                  character pages agree: of the 69 loadouts carrying a flat
 *                  weapon-power roll, (raw + flat)·(1+wpPct) reproduces the
 *                  page's own weapon-power total on 34 and never misses by more
 *                  than the sources we cannot read, while raw·(1+wpPct) + flat
 *                  reproduces it on exactly none.
 *   Crit           a list of skills, each { share, critRate, critDamage }.
 *                  critDamage 2.8 means a crit deals 2.8× (not 3.8×). Per-skill
 *                  expected factor = 1 + cr·(cd−1); the character factor is the
 *                  share-weighted sum. Crit rate is capped at 1.0 when a line
 *                  pushes it over. The "+1.5% on crit" rider on families 11/12
 *                  is crit-HIT damage: 1 + cr·(cd·(1+chd) − 1).
 *   Additional dmg one additive pool (weapon quality + pet + astrogem + neck,
 *                  optional Master), multiplying total damage as (1 + pool).
 *   Buckets        outgoing damage (undiluted), staggered, demon (diluted by the
 *                  demon damage you already carry), back/front, non-directional
 *                  are separate multiplicative buckets scaled by a share/uptime.
 *   Party lines    families 16/17/18/19 help the whole party. Scored as
 *                  1 + selfGain + allyCount × allyGain, with allies fixed at
 *                  90% crit / 280% crit damage and each assumed to deal the same
 *                  damage as the wearer before the line.
 *   Vitality, combat traits and the defensive/utility families score 0 damage;
 *                  their in-game value is still reported (traitValue / value).
 *
 * Support role: personal-damage components score 0. What pays instead is the
 * ally attack-power and ally damage riders, through the house support model
 * (ap / brand / identity — see supportContribution and
 * docs/research/support-model.md), plus the party DEBUFF halves of families
 * 16-19, which go through the same crit and defence functions the DPS side uses
 * because they land on every dealer whoever carries them.
 *
 * A support is scored on ONE damage dealer. Party size belongs on the gold axis.
 *
 * ============================ THE SOLVER ==============================
 *
 * Mechanics being modelled (docs/research/mechanics-bible-leaderboard.md):
 *   - Each attempt rerolls ALL unlocked granted slots as one set; locked lines
 *     persist. Afterwards you keep the old set or take the new one — whole set,
 *     no cherry-picking. So the outcome node is max(V(old), V(new)).
 *   - Draws inside one attempt are sequential without replacement: no duplicate
 *     family, capped categories dropped, everything renormalised by the
 *     surviving mass.
 *   - N normal rolls + M reconversion-ticket rolls (4 + 3 by default).
 *
 * Rerolls are treated as free: the cost is the bracelet, not the attempt. So
 * rolling weakly dominates stopping, V(s,n) is the EXPECTED FINAL SCORE under
 * optimal play, and the only real decisions are which lines to lock and, after
 * a roll, whether to keep or replace. Keep-or-replace compares CONTINUATION
 * values V(·, n−1), never immediate scores: a weaker set can be worth more when
 * the families it holds have been cleared out of the pool.
 *
 *     V(s, 0) = score(s)
 *     V(s, n) = max over lock masks m of  E_T[ max( V(s, n−1), V(T, n−1) ) ]
 *
 * A state's gold value is (V(s, n) − baseline) × goldPer1Pct; for an empty
 * granted set that is what an unrolled bracelet is worth to a buyer.
 *
 * Exactness and how it stays tractable:
 *   - Every family that scores 0 for the profile collapses into one "junk"
 *     label per category IN THE STATE, but stays a separate family DURING a
 *     draw, so the no-duplicate rule is still applied family by family.
 *   - Locking is offered only on scoring lines (locking a 0-damage line freezes
 *     a slot for nothing; see options.allowLockJunk to lift it). That is what
 *     lets junk collapse: the exclusion set only ever contains fixed and locked
 *     lines, which are always identified individually.
 *   - V(S,r) = max( stop, max over lock masks L of  −cost + F(L, r−1)(V(S,r−1)) )
 *     where F(L,r)(v) = Σ_T P(T|L)·max(v, V(T,r)). F depends on the state only
 *     through the locked lines, so it is built once per lock mask per layer as a
 *     sorted array with prefix sums and queried in O(log n). Without that, a
 *     three-slot solve would be a 40k × 40k transition matrix.

  // MODEL_SIG names the model; VERSION names the build of it. The Worker stores
  // MODEL_SIG + "@" + VERSION on every record and re-scores any record whose stamp
  // no longer matches, so BUMP VERSION whenever a change here can move a stored
  // number — otherwise every record already in KV keeps its old score forever.
  // 0.2.0: inferGrade() now reads the line count and the trait/basic bands, and no
  // longer defaults to relic when the payload carries no special-value evidence.
  // That moved two of the fifty-nine seeded characters by about 1.2pp.
  // 0.3.0: three changes, all of which move a stored score.
  //   - Spec and Swiftness are priced at 0.024245 a point, crit's own worth at
  //     110 on the default profile, so the three combat traits agree on shipped
  //     settings. They were a flat 0.025.
  //   - flatAP is 3,600, not 2,700: an ark-grid core's point thresholds ADD, so
  //     the Ancient attack core pays 900 at 10 points and another 2,700 at 17.
  //   - The support role is real. It was a stub with two flat per-percent
  //     constants; it is now the house ap / brand / identity model.
  // Every one of the fifty-nine seeded characters moved, by up to 0.22pp.
  // 0.4.0: four changes. The big one is that a SET is now scored jointly.
  //   - Crit, additional damage, weapon power and main stat POOL across the whole
  //     bracelet instead of each line being priced from the bare profile. Crit is
  //     capped at 100% once, over the pooled total, so a bracelet can no longer be
  //     paid for crit it cannot use: family 11 high + family 31 high + Crit 120 +
  //     Spec 120 scored 14.032 and is worth 11.043. Pooling the weapon-power
  //     components also retires the double square root inside families 21 and 22,
  //     which were 0.76% and 1.19% over at the top tier.
  //   - support.baseAdd and support.dpsWP are our own default dealer's numbers
  //     (0.3844 and 261,883.195), not the accessory calculator's inherited pair.
  //   - The DP prices a combat-trait DRAW instead of calling it junk, and counts
  //     the traits named in traitValues against the trait cap, so a bracelet with
  //     both places filled can no longer draw a dead third one.
  //   - The Python mirror's line_damage() normalises a partial profile, as the JS
  //     has always done; it used to raise KeyError: 'role'.
  // 0.4.1: the BOARD adopted the joint pool. worker score() and subrank's
  // braceletScore/anchors now price the whole bracelet through jointScore
  // instead of traitDamage + setDamage summed, which paid crit twice across the
  // two halves. 42 of 59 seeded characters move, most under 0.1pp; the two
  // crit-saturated ones land where the 0.4.0 audit predicted (Kyulo -8.4%,
  // Heero -5.7% against their pre-pooling scores).
  // 0.4.2: crit is UNCAPPED (Shizu). Overflow crit rate past 100% pays its
  // substitution value — a real player rebalances crit out of the rest of the
  // build, so the marginal pp keeps the (cd−1) slope it has below the cap. The
  // pool from 0.4.x stays: cross-terms still price jointly, so a crit-heavy set
  // sits below the old per-line double count and above the hard-cap floor.
  // Kyulo and Heero regain most of what 0.4.1 took (13.35 -> 14.41, 14.21 -> 15.08).
  // 0.5.0: the stagger share doubles, 10% -> 20% (Shizu, 2026-08-15). It is the
  // share of your damage that lands while the boss is staggered, and exactly one
  // family reads it — 13, "Damage +A%; damage to Staggered +B%". Only the second
  // half of that line scales, so the family gains 14-17%, not 100%: Ancient reads
  // 2.780 / 3.365 / 3.951 against 2.380 / 2.918 / 3.455. Every bracelet carrying
  // one moves, and family 13's letter grade may move with it.

  /**
   * A CONTRIBUTION RECORD is what one scoring atom — a line, a tier, the two
   * combat traits — adds to a bracelet, kept in the units the game adds them in
   * rather than already converted to damage:
   *
   *   dcr  crit rate, as a fraction (0.05 = +5 percentage points)
   *   dcd  crit damage, as a fraction (0.10 = +10pp, i.e. 2.8× -> 2.9×)
   *   chd  the "on crit, damage +x%" rider, as a fraction
   *   dAdd additional damage, in PERCENTAGE POINTS (the unit the tables print)
   *   dWp  flat weapon power, added to the raw pool
   *   dMs  flat main stat, added to the raw pool
   *   mult everything orthogonal, already a multiplier: outgoing, staggered,
   *        demon, positional, the party lines, attack/move speed, the support
   *        riders. Those genuinely do multiply line by line, so they are simply
   *        collected here.
   *
   * WHY THIS EXISTS. Damage is multiplicative BETWEEN buckets and additive
   * INSIDE one, and four of these buckets are shared by the whole bracelet:
   *
   *   - crit rate is capped at 100% per skill. Score three crit lines separately
   *     from the same base and you sell crit the character cannot use — a
   *     bracelet holding family 11 high, family 31 high, Crit 120 and Spec 120
   *     scored 14.032 when the joint truth is 11.043, 27% over.
   *   - additional damage is one additive pool; two lines feeding it dilute each
   *     other, and priced apart they do not.
   *   - flat weapon power and flat main stat both move ONE attack-power figure
   *     through a square root, so two of them are not two independent ratios.
   *     Families 21 and 22 carry two weapon-power components each and were
   *     multiplying two separate square-root ratios: 0.76% and 1.19% over at the
   *     top tier, fixed here for free by the pooling.
   *
   * So a SET is scored by summing the records, applying each shared bucket ONCE,
   * and multiplying the residual. A single line from the bare profile is that
   * same arithmetic over one record, which is why lineDamage() still means
   * exactly what it always meant.
   *
   * A flat log-space term (the Spec / Swiftness trait weights, a hand-written
   * test-pool atom) rides in `mult` as exp(D/100). The round trip costs about
   * 1e-16 and both mirrors take it in the same order, so they still agree.

   * traitDamage(traits, profile) -> D, the score of EVERY combat-trait line the

   *
   * traits = { crit, spec, swift } in trait points; an inactive trait is 0.
   *
   * THE RULE, and the one every scorer has to follow (2026-08-11):
   *
   *   Combat-trait lines score HERE. Effect lines score in setDamage(). A trait
   *   that rolled into a GRANTED slot is still a combat-trait line — Crit +104 is
   *   104 points of crit on the character whether the drop handed it over or a
   *   reroll did — so it belongs in this call, not in setDamage's.
   *
   * That split is not a detail. It is what keeps `linesPct` meaning "the effect
   * lines alone", the figure the board compares to lostark.bible's "Bracelet
   * Effects +X%" (which scores traits at zero) and the figure the loadout pick
   * ranks on. Push a granted trait through setDamage instead and the total comes
   * out right while linesPct silently gains two and a half points, moving
   * benchmark bands and, on at least one seeded character, the loadout the board
   * shows.
   *
   * The four scorers built on this model (worker/bracelet.js, leaderboard.js,
   * bible-import.js and the seed pipeline) all split the decoded lines themselves.
   * Three of them keyed the split on `line.fixed`, which is bible's LOCK icon and
   * not the drop's fixed/granted split — a player can lock a granted line — so a
   * granted trait fell through to setDamage and scored nothing. Read `cat`, never
   * `fixed`: `cat === "trait"` goes here, everything else goes to setDamage.
   *
   * WHAT THE DP DOES WITH IT. A granted trait keeps `fixed: false`, still counts
   * against the granted-slot total and is still rerollable — nothing here makes it
   * permanent. solve() carries this whole term as part of the base contribution
   * record, so the crit half of it meets the granted lines' crit inside one cap.
   *
   * The DP used to price a trait DRAW at zero as well, so it would roll a trait
   * away and never towards one — a gap in the advisor that cost any bracelet with
   * a trait place still open about 1.17 points of expected final score. Since
   * 0.4.0 buildAtoms() prices the draw at the band-weighted value it would land
   * on, and solve() counts the traits named in traitValues against the trait cap
   * so a bracelet with both places filled cannot draw a third. lineDamage() still
   * answers ZERO for a trait line, which is what the calculator's copy, the family
   * picker and `linesPct` are built on. Written up in docs/research/scoring-gap.md §7.
   *
   *   Crit   converts exactly: 25 pp of crit rate per 699 trait points, fed
   *          through the per-skill crit model additively with every other
   *          crit-rate source and capped at 100% — the same path granted
   *          family 31 takes. So it is worth less to a class already near cap.
   *   Spec   scored by the class's own weight, in points per 100 trait points.
   *   Swift  likewise.
   *
   * The trait term is added once, into solve()'s fixedDamage, and never enters the
   * DP alphabet.
   *
   * SINCE 0.4.0 the crit trait POOLS with everything else on the bracelet when the
   * bracelet is scored as a set — see traitContribution() below, which is what
   * jointScore() and the DP use. This function keeps its old meaning: every trait
   * line priced from the bare profile, one term added to the next. That is what
   * the display, the Tier List and the trait slider want, and it is what the four
   * set scorers still sum against setDamage(). It reads HIGH next to the joint
   * answer whenever the bracelet's other lines already push crit near the cap.

   *
   *   LINE COUNT   a bracelet carries 1-2 fixed lines plus its granted slots, and
   *                LINE_COUNTS says Relic grants 1-2 while Ancient grants 2-3. So

   *                payload cannot be Relic, whatever else it says. Unlike the
   *                granted-slot count the callers use, this witness survives the
   *                lock icon: a player can lock a granted line and make the
   *                fixed/granted split unreadable, but locking never changes how
   *                many lines the item has.
   *   TRAIT BAND   Relic combat traits run 41-100, Ancient 61-120. Either end
   *                rules a grade out; the callers only ever checked the top.
   *   BASIC BAND   the same for Str/Dex/Int and Vitality, whose bands do not
   *                overlap at the bottom either (Relic main stat starts at 6400,
   *                Ancient at 9600).
   *
   * The special-effect VALUE tables are deliberately not used here: Relic and
   * Ancient are one tier apart on every family (Relic mid = Ancient low), so a
   * value that fits one usually fits the other too. That evidence is a preference,
   * counted in inferGrade, never a ruling.
