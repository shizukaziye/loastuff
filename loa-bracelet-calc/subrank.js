/**
 * subrank.js — ONE subrank ladder for the whole tool, and the 0–100 bracelet
 * grade that rides on it.
 *
 * There used to be two ladders: the Tier List banded on six letters of its own,
 * and the Leaderboard had none. Both now read this file, so a letter means the
 * same thing wherever it appears.
 *
 * THE LADDER — astrogem's subranks, on flat 5-point bands of a percentage:
 *   S+ >=95  S >=90  S- >=85   A+ >=80  A >=75  A- >=70
 *   B+ >=65  B >=60  B- >=55   C+ >=50  C >=45  C- >=40
 *   D+ >=35  D >=30  D- >=25   F+ >=20  F >=10  F- <10
 * F is deliberately WIDE (20 points across F+ and F): a line worth a tenth of
 * the best line is not "one step worse" than a line worth a fifth, and F- is
 * reserved for the rows that are worth nothing at all.
 *
 * THE COLOURS are the astrogem calculator's, ported from its model/astrogem.js
 * rankColor() unchanged — F/D grey, C green, B blue, A purple as ramp anchors,
 * the intermediate steps read off that one ramp, and A+ through S+ leaving it
 * for an explicit cool-elite arc that ends on pale champagne. The two tools show
 * the same letter in the same colour, which is the whole point of porting rather
 * than inventing. Astrogem's ladder stops at F; our F+ and F- fall through to
 * its own +/- tilt on the F grey, which is what that fallback is for.
 *
 * THE BRACELET GRADE. braceletScore() maps a whole bracelet onto the same 0–100
 * scale the ladder bands:
 *
 *   score = 100 · (total − floor) / (perfect − floor),  clamped to [0, 100]
 *
 *   total   = Bracelet.setDamage(lines, grade, profile)
 *           + Bracelet.traitDamage(traits, profile)
 *     BOTH terms. setDamage() scores a combat trait in a granted slot as ZERO —
 *     only the two trait lines the bracelet came with carry value, and those
 *     come through traitDamage(). Dropping the second term was a live bug once;
 *     it is why the two are added here and never anywhere else.
 *   perfect = the three highest-scoring DISTINCT special families at `mid`
 *             (Epic) tier, plus two combat traits at 110 (Ancient) / 92 (Relic).
 *             A REACHABLE good bracelet, not a theoretical maximum — so scores
 *             run past 100 and S+ means you beat it.
 *   floor   = both combat traits at the BOTTOM of the grade's band (61 Ancient,
 *             41 Relic) and three lines worth nothing — i.e. just traitDamage()
 *             on that pair. Shizu's rule: the worst bracelet the game can hand
 *             you scores 0.
 *   ceiling = the literal maximum: the three best distinct families at their
 *             HIGH (Legendary) roll plus both traits at the top of the band.
 *             Nothing to do with the scale — it is what isPerfect tests, and it
 *             is the only thing that earns the rainbow.
 *
 * Everything is in LOG SPACE (the model's D units), not in converted
 * percentages: the model adds in log space, so the scale has to.
 *
 * THE ANCHORS, read off model VERSION 0.4.0 on 2026-08-14. Ancient, damage
 * dealer: perfect = 19.97% damage, floor = 3.01%, ceiling = 22.76% (score 115.1).
 * Ancient, support: perfect = 6.44%, floor = 0.60%, ceiling = 7.54% (score 118.1).
 * They move whenever the model moves — this file computes them, it does not
 * carry them, and the version stamp is here so a reader can tell a stale quote
 * from a wrong one. Print anchorsFor("ancient") before believing anything else
 * this file says.
 *
 * NO NETWORK, no state, no DOM. Pure arithmetic over window.Bracelet.

  /**
   * The SUPPORT ladder, cut so that a letter means the same RARITY it means on
   * the DPS one — a support A- is as rare as a damage dealer's A-.
   *
   * The two axes already share a score shape and both normalise to their own
   * floor and anchor, but their distributions have different SHAPES. A support's
   * value is packed into six families where a dealer's is spread over thirty, so
   * the same cut lands at a different rarity on each and a shared ladder would
   * make every support rank a quiet lie. The astrogem calculator hit this first
   * and answered it the same way: match the rarities, not the numbers.
   *
   * Produced by tools/rank-match.mjs, which is exact rather than sampled — the
   * model's own DP returns the whole distribution of finished line scores after
   * seven attempts of optimal keep-or-replace, and that is convolved with the two
   * combat traits drawn from Stove's weighted bands.
   *
   * ROUNDED, on Shizu's call (2026-08-14). The exact rarity-matched cuts are
   * arbitrary decimals — 98.8, 83.2, 60.5 — so these are the nearest ladder built
   * from round numbers with a constant gap inside each stretch: a 10-point step
   * below S+, then 7.5 down the letter grades to B, then a flat 5 all the way to
   * the bottom.
   *
   * The two ends are chosen rather than fitted, and both mean something:
   *   S+ = 100  you reached the anchor, exactly as on the DPS ladder
   *   F  = 0    the worst bracelet the game can hand you — both combat traits at
   *             the bottom of the band and three lines worth nothing
   *
   * The rounding costs a mean rarity error of ×1.11, and every band holds real
   * occupancy rather than sitting empty for the look of the thing. Reusing the DPS
   * numbers outright would cost ×4.26 with B+ landing 8.5× too rare, which is why
   * this is not simply the same ladder twice.
   *
   * Rerun tools/rank-match.mjs after any change that moves a line's damage, then
   * tools/support-ladder-round.mjs to re-round against the new exact cuts.
   *
   * EVERY band is matched, S+ included: on the corrected distribution a fresh
   * Ancient bracelet reaches 115 on the DPS axis and 118 on the support one, so
   * there is real mass above 100 and no band needs guessing at.
   *
   * The first version of this table was WRONG, and the way it was wrong is worth
   * recording. tools/rank-match.mjs called Bracelet.solve() with invented key
   * names — `lines` and `traits` rather than `fixedLines`, `grantedLines`,
   * `traitValues` and `slots`. Every one fell through to a default, so it solved
   * TWO granted slots instead of three with the combat-trait category still live
   * in the draw pool, which put a 35% chance of a dead line on every slot of
   * every roll. The tell was that the DP's optimal play scored BELOW a crude
   * threshold heuristic, which an optimal solver cannot do; tools/roll-sim.mjs
   * exists to catch exactly that.
