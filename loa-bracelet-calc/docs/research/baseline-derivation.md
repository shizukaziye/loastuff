## Serca gear table (honing level → per-piece main stat / weapon WP)

Level 0 = ilvl 1675, +5 ilvl per level, level 25 = 1800. Verbatim from bebkok:

Character ilvl = ROUND(mean of the six piece ilvls, 2). Default build weapon 25,
gloves 23, others 21 → exactly 1785. (Aegir-gear table exists in the sheet too, with
Advanced Honing +2%/+5% multipliers; Serca gear has no AH bonus. Not needed for v1.)

## Baseline assembly

Main stat raw = Σ five armor pieces + accessories + base 477 + roster bonus (default
2085). Accessories at max (loseii lost-ark-accessories MAIN_RANGE tops, no flats):
neck 17,857 + 2× earring 13,889 + 2× ring 12,897 = **71,429**.
Main stat total = raw × (1 + msPct); **msPct default 0.08 (skins, per Shizu)**;
stronghold ranch would add +0.01 (option, off by default).

Weapon power raw = weapon table value (accessory WP flats = 0 under no-flats).
WP total = raw × (1 + wpPct); wpPct = earring WP% lines 3%×2 = **6%** at max-no-flats
+ karma (sheets: up to 3%, 2.5% "non-whale"; default TBD by Shizu).

Attack power = sqrt(MStot × WPtot / 6) × (1 + baseApPct) + flatAP
- baseApPct = damage gems + ability stone, AND NOTHING ELSE (Shizu, 2026-08-12).
  Gems: lv6 0.45% / lv7 0.6% / lv8 0.8% / lv9 1.0% / lv10 1.2%, eleven of them, with
  anything below lv6 counting nothing. Stone: 1.5% once its two engraving levels
  total five or more — 9/7, 10/6, 9/9 and up; 9/6, 8/7 and 7/7 pay nothing.
  It cancels in most ratios but shifts the sqrt-vs-flat balance.
- flatAP: the accessories' "Attack Power +80/195/390" rolls, plus an ark-grid ATTACK
  core. A core's thresholds ADD: +900 at 10 points and +1,800 relic / +2,700 ancient
  at 17, so a core at 17+ points totals **2,700 relic / 3,600 ancient**.
- flatWP: the accessories' "Weapon Power +195/480/960" rolls, plus an ark-grid WEAPON
  core: +1,300 at 10 and +2,600 / +3,900 at 17, totalling **3,900 relic / 5,200
  ancient**. Points above 17 pay only a percentage (+0.16% each), which joins the
  whole-term attack-power bucket and cancels out of every line ratio. Flat weapon
  power goes INSIDE the square root, where the weapon-power bucket amplifies it.
  A build runs an attack core or a weapon core, not both.
- The overall AP% bucket (accessory AP% 3.1%, the ark-grid attack core's percentage
  thresholds ~2.7%, the level-60 side node 2.2%, Adrenaline 9%) multiplies the whole
  AP term → cancels out of every bracelet-line ratio; ignore it.

  **BASE AP% AND AP% ARE DIFFERENT STATS (Shizu, 2026-08-14, ruled twice).** Never fold
  the second into the first. baseApPct sits INSIDE the square root and comes from gems
  and the stone alone; the wider bucket sits outside it and takes the flats with it. On a
  SUPPORT the distinction has teeth: the ally attack-power buff is a share of the
  support's BASE attack power, so the wider bucket never reaches it, and putting those
  eight-odd percentage points into baseApPct would overstate every support buff. See
  support-model.md §11 — loa-gpd's reference-character.md argues the other way and is
  wrong on this point.

Default 1785 baseline (msPct 8%, before karma/flatAP decisions):
armor MS 629,835 → raw 703,826 → MS_tot 760,132; WP raw 241,367.

## Bracelet-line scoring corrections (vs the naive spec)

1. **Flat AP breaks pure sqrt.** Gain of +ΔWP =
   (sqrt((WPraw+Δ)(1+wpPct) × MStot/6)(1+baseApPct) + flatAP) / (same with Δ=0).
   Main-stat lines likewise, with Δ × (1+msPct) — i.e. percent buckets amplify added
   raw stat; with flatAP=0 this reduces to the sqrt ratio.
2. **Crit-hit-damage rider** (families 11/12 "+1.5% damage on crit"): crit branch is
   1 + cr·(cd·(1+chd) − 1). The rider adds chd +0.015, NOT additional damage.
3. **Master node = +7% crit rate AND +8.5% additional damage** (Arsonistic Calc!E24/E25;
   note says Master is the only temporary AddDmg buff). Shizu's "Master +7% AddDmg" was
   off — pending his confirmation, the toggle applies both numbers.
4. **Additional-damage baseline pool** = weapon quality 0.30 + pet 0.01 + neck 0.026 +
   astrogem grid **0.0484** (60 levels × 0.080667%/lvl per loseii astrogem.js; bebkok
   0.08086, Arsonistic 0.08077 — spread irrelevant) = **0.3844** (+0.085 if Master on).
   Line value = (1+pool+Δ)/(1+pool).
5. **Demon-damage line dilutes** against existing demon sources: sheets carry ~7%
   (cards/pets, "up to 7.3%"); factor (1 + Δ/(1+0.073)) applied × demon-boss share.
6. **Outgoing damage is its own multiplicative bucket** (sheet multiplies outgoing
   sources) → bracelet outgoing line = flat ×(1+Δ), no dilution.
7. **Family 15 (+dmg, +2% cooldown)**: sheet scores it as the mean of burst gain
   (full +A%) and sustained gain (+A% then ÷1.02) → cooldownPenaltyWeight input,
   default 0.5.
8. **Stagger share default 5%** of damage dealt during stagger windows (sheet Brace!Q16).
9. **Positional base facts** (for share inputs): front attack ×1.20 base; back attack
   ×1.05 and +10% crit rate. Bracelet positional lines apply to that skill share only.
10. **Speed/utility families (1, 10 etc.)** stay 0 damage in v1 (attack-speed value via
    Raid Captain exists in the sheets but is out of scope).
11. **Bracelet basic-stat values are CONTINUOUS bands** (official page), not the four
    tier points Arsonistic's Brace tab lists — official wins. Live payload Int +13888
    fits official band 7 (13441–14080). ✔

## Cross-checks

- Arsonistic's Brace tab line values match the official probability table exactly
  (Relic-low column = Relic grade low tier). Independent confirmation of family values.
- Loseii accessory-tool defaults (MS 750k, WP 250k, additional 35.85%) sit within a few
  % of the bebkok-derived 1785 baseline — consistent.
- Other ark-grid side-node coefficients (per level): AP 0.0003667, boss dmg 0.000834
  (bebkok S4:S9) — future use.

## Shizu's rulings (2026-08-11)

- **Master toggle = +7% additional damage only** (his call, overriding Arsonistic's
  +7% crit / +8.5% AddDmg — do not "fix" this without asking him).
- karma WP% = **2.5%** → baseline wpPct = 0.085.
- ranch included → baseline msPct = **0.09**.
- ark-grid core default = **ancient ATTACK core at 17+ points** → flatAP 3600,
  flatWP 0.
- baseApPct default = **full level-9 damage gems + a stone worth its 1.5%** =
  11 × 1.0% + 1.5% = **0.125**, adjustable (per-gem: lv6 0.45% / lv7 0.6% /
  lv8 0.8% / lv9 1.0% / lv10 1.2%).
