# Gameplan — catch the bracelet calculator up to astrogem

Written 2026-08-11 (Fable) for an overnight autonomous run. Shizu is asleep; no
questions possible, so every open choice is decided here and recorded.

## What "complete" can mean tonight

Two things need Shizu and cannot be done:

- **No character fetching.** The authorization token is not on disk (`.bible-token`
  absent) and every request must carry it. So: **zero requests to lostark.bible tonight**,
  for any reason, by any agent. The 29-page corpus already on disk is the working set;
  the remaining 28 names wait for him.
- **No worker deploy.** KV namespaces and secrets live on his Cloudflare account.

So the target is: **everything built, verified, deployed to GitHub Pages, and working
end-to-end without the worker** — with the worker one `wrangler deploy` away.

The enabling decision: **the leaderboard reads baked seed data by default and switches
to the worker when `WORKER_URL` answers.** Same pattern as `loa-deal-finder`, which bakes
its data into the page. He wakes up to a live board, not a placeholder.

## Order of work

Serialised where files collide, parallel where they don't. `app.js` and `index.html` are
the contention points, so exactly one agent owns them at a time.

**Phase 0 — finish in flight.** The multi-loadout re-parse (offline, saved pages only).
Its output rewrites `data/leaderboard-seed.json` with all loadouts per character and a
`chosenLoadout` = highest score. Everything downstream depends on that shape.

**Phase 1 — shell and spine.** One agent owns `app.js` + `index.html`.
- Port `favorites.js` and `tip.js` verbatim from astrogem; copy the 29 class icons.
- Extract the character/bracelet customizer out of `app.js` into **`profile.js`**
  (`get/set/mount/onChange/reset`, one localStorage key) so every tab drives one state.
- Wire the tab bar for Calculator · Tier List · Leaderboard · Method · Feedback, with the
  lazy-loader and `?v=` discipline.
- Port the profile header: class icon, name link, cache pill, chips.

**Phase 2 — three tabs in parallel** (each owns one new file; I add script tags).
- **Leaderboard** (`leaderboard.js`): astrogem's structure, our columns — rank, name,
  class icon, grade, damage %, gap to #1, lines, last pulled. Region/class filters
  persisted in localStorage, name search, `PAGE_SIZE` 100, pinned ★ favourites section
  with true ranks, four degradation messages, a real Refresh button, self-reported
  footer. Data source: baked seed → worker when available.
- **Tier List** (`tierlist.js`): all 33 families and all 99 rolls ranked, live on every
  slider drag (pure scoring, no worker), loa-tierlist banding (S ≥98 … F <80 of the best
  line), hover cards, click-to-try.
- **Worker** (`worker/`): fork astrogem's worker as the literal starting point; strip gem
  parsing; keep queue/drain/breaker/snapshot/rate-limits/CORS/admin; swap in the bracelet
  parser and the raw-payload record; apply the audit fix list — timeout on every fetch,
  CE→EU normalised once at the router, drop the dead premium lane, name/region length
  caps, real paths instead of overloaded query params.

**Phase 3 — integration.** Script tags, cache-bust bumps, browser verification at desktop
and 375px, both verify batteries green, then push to GitHub Pages and confirm live.

## Standing rules for every agent

1. **No network requests to lostark.bible.** Not one. No token, no fetching.
2. **Raid statistics are banned** — never referenced, never fetched, never served.
3. The client talks only to our worker; only the worker may talk to lostark.bible, and
   only with the token.
4. `node verify.js` and `python verify.py` must both end green (1601+).
5. Plain ES5-flavoured IIFEs, zero dependencies, no build step, dark-only house style.
6. Bump `?v=` on every touched file — the loseii zone edge-caches JS for four hours.
7. Commit at the end of each phase, **and push** (rule changed 2026-08-15: Shizu
   expected pushes to be happening — "have you not been pushing for me" — so
   the old do-not-push rule is dead. Run `npm run check` first; a push deploys
   the live site through Pages).
8. Never invent data. A missing character is missing.

## Decisions made on Shizu's behalf (flag at wake-up)

- **Demon toggle stays OFF by default.** The evidence says bible counts it and turning it
  on aligns us with their numbers, but it changes every leaderboard score and he has been
  asked twice without answering. Not a call to make while he sleeps. The tier list makes
  the consequence visible, which is the better way to settle it.
- **Seed data ships.** He confirmed scraping is permitted with the token, and told
  molenzwiebel about the project. The board carries the self-reported disclosure.
- ~~**Support scoring stays a stub.** DPS-only, as speced.~~ **SUPERSEDED 2026-08-14.**
  Supports are real now — the house ap / brand / identity model, a role toggle in the
  deck and on the Tier List, and a rank ladder cut at the DPS ladder's own rarities.
  See `docs/research/support-model.md`.

- **Rule 6 above is now enforced, not remembered.** `npm run check` runs the two
  parity batteries, the worker battery, and `tools/check-cache-versions.mjs`, which
  fails the moment a changed script still carries its old `?v=`. That rule had already
  been missed twice — two of the three commits before the tool exists are manual
  "bump cache-busters" fixups — and the failure mode is silent wrong numbers rather
  than an error, because the browser happily runs a new `subrank.js` against an old
  `model/bracelet.js`.

## Rulings from the 2026-08-14 review pass — do not re-litigate

Three reviewer recommendations were put to Shizu and overruled. A later session
reading only the review evidence would reach the reviewers' conclusions again, so
the rulings are recorded here with their reasons.

- **Family 22 stays at 30 stacks.** The naive reading of the tooltip — one stack
  per 30s, each lasting 120s, so at most 4 alive — was considered and is wrong
  about the game: each new stack refreshes the pile, so it climbs to the full 30
  over about fifteen minutes and holds. "Always assume max stacks" therefore
  means 30 here. The Method tab prose said four and was the thing corrected.

- **Family 28 keeps its damage conversion.** The reviewer read the 0.1-per-percent
  shield/heal constant as a placeholder paying gold for a non-damage stat and
  recommended zeroing it. Shizu: "it provides damage when you shield — this is
  correct." Bigger shields mean more shielded uptime for the party, and shielded
  allies deal more damage through the shielded-target effects, so the conversion
  is a modelling choice, not a stub.

- **Supports on the board: the better-letter rule.** A support-class character
  (Bard, Paladin, Artist, Valkyrie — Guardian Knight is NOT a support) is scored
  both ways and shown on whichever axis grades their bracelet better. A dealer-
  spec Bard reads as a dealer; a support bracelet reads on the support ladder
  with its % labelled per-dealer. No separate board, no badge-only compromise.

## Open for Shizu — 2026-08-14

**1. The rank breakpoints.** `docs/research/score-distribution.md` has the exact
distribution on both axes, every 5 points and one point at a time through the top.
The damage dealer's ladder turns out to be a clean geometric rarity ladder already;
the only defect is the bottom, where F, F+ and F- hold 3.5% between them. Moving F to
20 and F+ to 25 fixes that and costs nothing else. Not done — his call. If it is
taken, rerun `tools/rank-match.mjs` and paste the support ladder it prints, because
the support cuts are derived from the DPS rarities.

**2. Supports on the leaderboard. LIVE, not hypothetical.** The seed carries no
supports, which is what I first checked and reported — but the live KV snapshot has
62 characters against the seed's 59, and two of them are Bards: **Limerent** and
**Na**, both NA. Both are ranked as damage dealers right now. The board scores
everyone on `normalizeProfile({})`, which is role "dps". It does not break loudly, which is
the problem. A near-perfect support bracelet (families 17, 19 and 30 at Legendary,
110/110 traits) reads:

| scored as | score | band | damage |
|---|---|---|---|
| a damage dealer, which is what the board does | 80.2 | A | 16.40% |
| a support | 106.3 | S+ | 6.85% |

The 16.40% is the tell: it counts the party-debuff halves of families 17 and 19 as
damage the support itself deals, which a support does not do. Fixing it needs two
decisions — map class to role (Bard, Paladin, Artist are the three), and then either
rank supports on their own board or interleave them on the support ladder so a
letter still means one thing. Neither is a call to make while he sleeps.

**3. ~~A support's gold.~~ SETTLED — it was never a gap.** Shizu, 2026-08-14: the
support axis reports **the damage gain on one damage dealer**, and that is what it
should report. There is no party multiplier anywhere in the model and none is
wanted. A support's buffs do land on all three dealers, so the party-wide figure is
three times this one, but a number you can hold against a damage dealer's own
bracelet is the more useful one and multiplying by party size would make the two
axes incomparable. Stated in the Method tab under "A support is scored on one
damage dealer". Do not "fix" this.

**4. The Worker still needs a redeploy.** The model went to 0.3.0 and stored records
will not re-score until it ships. The seed on disk is already rescored (59/59).
