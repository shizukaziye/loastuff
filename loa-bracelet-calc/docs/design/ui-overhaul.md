# Input UI overhaul — design blueprint (Fable, from Shizu's spec, 2026-08-11)

Principle: **mouse-first**. Sliders for quantities, segmented buttons for small option
sets, toggle buttons for on/off. Typing only where a number is truly free-form
(baseline %, WP/MS override, skill name). Every slider shows its value in a chip that
updates live. All controls persist to localStorage as before.

## Layout (desktop ≥900px)

Replace the single CHARACTER panel body with a two-column control deck inside the same
sticky panel. Results area below is unchanged.

Mobile (<900px): single column, order = GEAR, ilvl readout, accessory/gem controls,
FIGHT, SKILLS, ECONOMY.

## Left column — GEAR

1. **Six honing sliders**, one per piece, order Weapon, Head, Shoulder, Chest, Pants,
   Gloves. Range 0–25, step 1, defaults W25 / G23 / others 21. Weapon's track uses the
   accent color (it alone drives WP). Value chip shows "+N".
2. **ITEM LEVEL readout** top-right of the gear block: big numeral (~28px,
   accent-colored), label "ITEM LEVEL" above it in .note style. Live = round(mean of
   six piece ilvls, 2). This is the anchor the eye checks after any slider move.
3. **Neck bonus** segmented control, options **0% / 0.7% / 1.6% / 2.6%**, default 2.6%.
   Sets the neck term of the additional-damage pool. Label "Neck · additional damage".
   (0.7 is Arsonistic's low tier; Shizu chose these four options explicitly.)
4. **Earring 1 / Earring 2 WP%** — two separate segmented controls, options
   **0% / 0.8% / 1.8% / 3%**, default 3% each. wpPct = earring1 + earring2 + karma
   (karma stays in Advanced, default 2.5%).
5. **Gems slider**: discrete 6/7/8/9/10 with tick marks and labels under the track,
   default 9. Label "Damage gems (all eleven)". Per-gem base-AP%: lv6 0.4 / lv7 0.6 /
   lv8 0.8 / lv9 1.0 / lv10 1.2; baseApPct = 11 × per-gem + stone.
6. **Buttons row**: `[9/7 stone]` toggle default ON (+1.5% base AP);
   `[Master]` toggle default OFF (+7% additional damage — Shizu's ruling, unchanged).
   House .mbtn style with a clear on state (accent border + fill), state word inside
   the button ("9/7 stone · on").

The "Enter WP / main stat directly" override checkbox stays, ABOVE the sliders; when
checked it swaps the six sliders + accessory controls for the two number fields
(unchanged behavior).

## Right column — FIGHT

Sliders (0–100%, step 1, value chip "N%"):
- Back attack share, default 0
- Front attack share, default 0
- Non-directional share, default 0
- **Cooldown penalty weight, default 70%** (spec change from 50% — update model
  default + refs + Method copy)

Toggle button: **Demon boss** default OFF. ON sets demonShare = 1, OFF = 0 (dilution
pool 7.3% unchanged, stays in Advanced).

## SKILLS (right column, under FIGHT)

Keep current structure, but the name field is narrow and the rows are typed inputs
(see revisions below).

## TRAITS (right column, between FIGHT and SKILLS) — added by Shizu mid-build

The bracelet's two fixed combat-trait lines now carry value in the score.

1. **Two weight sliders** — Spec / Swiftness weight only, range **0–4%, step 0.1,
   default 2.5%** each. Unit: **% damage per 100 trait points**. Crit gets NO slider
   (Shizu 2026-08-11): a crit trait line converts exactly at **25% crit rate per 699
   points** (value × 25/699 pp) and is scored through the per-skill crit model —
   additive with the other crit-rate sources before the 100% cap, same path as
   granted family 31.
2. **Starting trait values on the bracelet** — three slider rows (Crit, Spec,
   Swiftness), each with an active toggle; **exactly two active** (activating a third
   deactivates the least-recently-touched; with two active the toggles of active rows
   can swap but never drop below/above two). Active slider range = the official band:
   **Ancient 61–120, Relic 41–100** (switches with grade). Inactive trait = 0.
   Default: Crit 120 + Spec 120 active, Swiftness inactive.
3. Scoring: trait contribution = Σ_active value × weight ÷ 100, added as
   percentage points in the same log-space convention as line scores. It is a
   CONSTANT offset w.r.t. rerolling (fixed lines never reroll) — it must appear in
   currentScore, expectedFinal, valueGold, and the per-line breakdown (two rows for
   the fixed traits), but the DP's decisions are unaffected by construction; do NOT
   thread it through the DP state.
4. Trait rows live in the BRACELET panel (they are bracelet lines, above the granted
   slots); the three WEIGHT sliders live in the FIGHT column (they are character
   properties).



Keep current structure, but:
- **Name field much narrower** (~110px, placeholder "name") — Shizu's complaint.
- Share / crit rate / crit damage become **sliders** with value chips:
  share 0–100 step 1; crit rate 0–100 step 1 default 90; crit damage 100–400 step 5
  default 280.
- **Shares must sum to 100 — enforced, not hinted**: with one skill the share slider
  is locked at 100 (disabled look). With N>1, moving one slider proportionally
  rebalances the others so the total is always exactly 100 (largest-remainder to keep
  integers); a new skill enters at an equal share. Remove the old "shares sum to 100%"
  hint text — impossible states shouldn't exist.

## ECONOMY (right column, bottom)

Unchanged: gpd dropdown + baseline % number field.

## Advanced fold (everything Shizu didn't name)

msPct, karma WP%, baseApPct fine-override, flatAP, accessory main stat, roster bonus,
AddDmg components other than neck (weapon 30%, pet 1%, astrogem 4.84%), demon pool
7.3%, shield uptime 60%, enemy DR 50%, stagger share (**default now 10%**, spec
change), fixed-lines editor. WP-line (families 20/21/22) uptime/stack assumptions:
**fix at 100% and REMOVE from Advanced** (hard assumption now, note it in Method).

## Model default changes (update model/bracelet.js + bracelet.py + refs + Method)

- cooldownPenaltyWeight 0.5 → **0.7**
- staggerShare 0.05 → **0.10**
- families 20/21/22 uptime/stacks → **1.0 (max stacks, full uptime)**
- keep both verify batteries green; update the affected ref values deliberately
  (recompute by hand where the case is hand-derived, don't just paste outputs).

## Shizu's live-review revisions (2026-08-11, during build)

1. FIGHT sliders renamed + redefaulted: **"Back" 100%**, **"Front" 100%**,
   **"Hitmaster"** (was non-directional) **100%**.
2. Delete the explainer texts "— what a trait line is worth to you" and "Crit needs
   no weight: …" (the tooltips carry that job).
3. SKILLS: back to **typed number inputs** in rows (Shizu reversed the slider call for
   this section only). Narrow name field stays; shares still enforced to sum 100.
4. ECONOMY becomes sliders: **baseline 0–25%**; **gpd logarithmic 100k–10M** (log-scale
   track, value chip shows e.g. "1.50M").
5. The inputs panel must NOT require collapsing to reach results: normal document flow
   (no full-height sticky trap), page scroll reveals results. Collapse stays available
   but triggers from a click anywhere on the panel header, not just the arrow.
6. Gear slider order: Head, Shoulder, Chest, Pants, Gloves, **Weapon last**.
7. More data-gloss tooltips "anywhere that might seem weird" — Shizu loves them.
   Candidates: ilvl readout, neck bonus, earring WP%, gems slider, 9/7 stone, Master,
   Demon boss, CD penalty weight, trait active toggles, spec/swift weights, unrolled
   card, P(improve), quantile strip, mask table headers, baseline, gpd.
8. Phase 4 note (not this build): the leaderboard scores everyone with the DEFAULT
   profile — canonical defaults, not each player's tweaked knobs.

## Granted-slot picker redesign (Shizu, 2026-08-11)

The family picker must NOT show roll values (+X%) — values depend on the tier, which
is the second box's job, and per-option value coloring confused him.

1. **Family box**: family name only, prefixed with an **astrogem-style letter grade
   (F→S)** using the astrogem calculator's grade colors (copy the palette/classes from
   loa-astrogem-calc). The grade rates the family's AVERAGE roll under the canonical
   default profile: score each tier, weight by within-family tier odds (6:3:1 →
   0.6/0.3/0.1), then band RELATIVE to the best family's average. Bands: monotone,
   round thresholds, zero-damage families = F, best family = S. Grade is computed
   from defaults, NOT the user's current knobs (stable labels).
2. **Tier box**: three options with the actual values and the in-game rarity colors —
   Rare (blue) / Epic (purple) / Legendary (gold), e.g. "Legendary — +10%". Color the
   selected state accordingly.
3. **Row order (Shizu, live review): tier box FIRST, family box SECOND.** The family
   select is currently far too wide — shrink it (truncate long labels with ellipsis,
   full text in the tooltip/title); the tier box is narrow and leads the row.
4. Bracelet trait VALUE fields (crit/spec/swift starting values): **typed number
   inputs, not sliders** (Shizu). Keep the band clamp (Ancient 61–120 / Relic 41–100)
   and the exactly-two-active toggles. The spec/swift WEIGHT controls stay sliders.

## Round-two picker + trait revisions (Shizu, 2026-08-11)

1. **Collapse every F family into ONE option labelled "Junk Line"** in the granted-slot
   family picker. Keep D (Str/Dex/Int) as its own option. Selecting "Junk Line" means
   "a zero-damage line" — the model already treats them identically, so one entry is
   honest and removes ~15 rows of noise. The specific junk family is not tracked in
   the UI (the DP's junk aggregation already assumes this).
2. **Longer family labels** — the shrink went too far; give the family box more width
   and truncate later.
3. **Grade color must show on the CLOSED select**, not only in the open dropdown
   (a native <select> can't color its closed text per-option — use a custom
   button+listbox, or paint the closed control from the selected option's grade).
4. **Traits: no auto-deactivation.** Turning on a third trait is ALLOWED; instead show
   a clear warning that the state is illegal in game (a bracelet only ever has two),
   and keep scoring what's entered. Do not silently switch anything off.

### What the build found (Fable, 2026-08-11) — where the collapse stops

The collapse is safe for **granted slots** and only for granted slots.

A junk line is never locked (`allowLockJunk` is off), so it is always rerolled away
and never reaches `buildPool`'s present-family set or its per-category count. Solving
the same bracelet with a junk combat trait, with Vitality and with a junk special
returns bit-identical numbers, so which family stands in for "Junk Line" cannot change
a granted answer. Combat traits fold in with the rest.

A **fixed** line never rerolls, so it sits in the pool's present set and its category
count for good — and there the category decides a great deal. Two fixed combat traits
close the whole 35% trait share of the pool; two fixed junk specials close almost
nothing (expected final 5.94% against 4.49%, three slots, seven rolls). The Advanced
fixed-line editor therefore still lists every family by name.

Two consequences for the stand-in itself:

- It must be a **special**. Specials cap at five, so three junk slots plus two fixed
  lines always fit; traits cap at TWO, so resolving junk to a trait would make three
  junk slots fail `validateSet`.
- Each granted slot gets a **different** stand-in, skipping anything a fixed line
  already holds, or two junk slots would read as a duplicate roll and the cut flow
  would reject a legal roll.

## Character profile, astrogem-grader style (Shizu, 2026-08-11)

Shizu: "create the calculator like the grader profile on the astrogem calculator."
Mirror `loastuff/loa-astrogem-calc/grader.js` — signing in should make the whole
character profile stop being hand-entered.

- Sign in → character list (astrogem's favourites/roster spine) → pick a character →
  the tool loads THAT character and grades their real bracelet.
- Auto-fill everything derivable from their page: item level / per-piece honing (or
  the WP + main-stat override straight from their profile numbers), class, crit rate
  and crit damage, gem levels, additional-damage pool components. Manual controls stay
  available and clearly marked as overridden-by-import until the user edits them.
- Keep a visible "scored on defaults" vs "scored on this character" distinction: the
  LEADERBOARD always ranks on canonical defaults; the calculator may use the imported
  profile. Never let an imported profile silently change a leaderboard number.

## Craft notes

- Segmented controls and toggles are buttons with aria-pressed; sliders are native
  <input type=range> styled to the house theme (accent thumb, .panel2 track) — no
  custom drag code.
- Slider changes go through the existing 300ms debounce → worker; segmented/toggle
  changes solve immediately.
- Value chips are text, not inputs — except crit damage and baseline where a click on
  the chip turns it into a tiny number input (escape hatch for precise values).
- Bump ?v= on every touched file.

## Queued after the current pass (Shizu, 2026-08-11)

### Advisor tab
The roll advice — best lock mask and the per-mask table, P(improve), the quantile
strip, and the cut flow (enter what you rolled, keep-or-replace verdict, apply,
undo, session history) — moves OUT of the Calculator's results into its own
**Advisor** tab, the way astrogem separates Grader from Advisor. The Calculator
keeps the bracelet itself: the lines, the score, the worth, the breakdown.
Both tabs mount the same shared deck.

### Pricing an unrolled bracelet by its combat traits
An unrolled bracelet's value depends almost entirely on the two combat traits it
came with, because those never reroll: 120/120 is worth far more than 80/80 and
today the tool prices them the same.

Add a **combat-trait total** slider to the unrolled-value card: range **80–240**
(the two traits summed — 120+120 = 240 is the cap, 40+40 = 80 the floor), and
show what an unrolled bracelet with that total is worth. Split the total evenly
across the two active traits unless the user has set them individually, in which
case keep their ratio. It must recompute live and read off the same worth formula
as everything else, `E[max(0, final% − baseline%)] × gpd`, so the number is
comparable to every other price the tool quotes.

This is the feature that answers "what should I pay for this bracelet", which is
the whole reason the tool exists — the trait pair is the part you cannot change.
