/**
 * tierlist.js — the Tier List tab: every bracelet effect ranked by what it is
 * worth to YOUR character, live.
 *
 * Ranking is pure scoring — no DP, no solver, no worker — so 33 or 99 rows come
 * out in well under a millisecond and the table recomputes on every input event
 * instead of being debounced into a worker the way the Calculator's advice is.
 * That immediacy is the whole point: drag Back share to 0 and watch the
 * positional lines fall through the table.
 *
 * WHAT IT SHOWS
 *   By family (40 rows, default) — each special family at its odds-weighted
 *     average roll (the three tiers land 6:3:1, so 0.6 low + 0.3 mid + 0.1 high).
 *     Same number Bracelet.familyGrades() computes for the Calculator's picker,
 *     so the two can never disagree about which family is better.
 *   By roll (106 rows) — every family x tier separately, coloured by rarity:
 *     low = Rare blue, mid = Epic purple, high = Legendary gold. A Legendary junk
 *     line sitting far below a Rare crit line is the lesson the table teaches.
 *   Both views also carry the seven lines that roll a CONTINUOUS value and so
 *     have no tiers to split: main stat, and the six combat traits. They are
 *     scored at the band-weighted expected roll and contribute one row either
 *     way. Combat traits cannot reach a granted slot at all — the model assumes
 *     the drop filled both trait places — so those rows are there to weigh a
 *     trait against a special line, not to roll towards. See rank().
 *
 * BANDING: the shared eighteen-step subrank ladder in subrank.js, applied to
 * 100 x d / THE ANCHOR OF THIS VIEW — see rank() for what each view anchors on
 * and why the two differ.
 *
 * A line that does no damage is pinned to F- whatever the arithmetic says. On a
 * six-band ladder every empty band was drawn, because an empty A tier was
 * information; on eighteen it is noise, so empty bands are skipped and the strip
 * above the table carries the shape of the distribution instead.
 *
 * ALWAYS THE DEFAULT CHARACTER (Shizu, 2026-08-12: "for tier list lets just make
 * it simple and remove character select / character board and leave it to our
 * defaults"). This tab had a character picker and the shared control deck; both
 * are gone. Every row is scored on Bracelet.normalizeProfile({}) — the canonical
 * build, every setting untouched — so the ranking is a fact about the game rather
 * than about whoever last dragged a slider on another tab.
 *
 * That buys three simplifications. There is no window.Profile here at all, so a
 * deck edit on the Calculator cannot move this table and this table cannot move
 * the Calculator. The GHOST TICK is gone with it: it marked where each line sat
 * for the default character, and on a table that IS the default character it sat
 * under the end of every bar, always. And the anchors below are stable, because
 * nothing can move them.
 *
 * WHAT STILL TOGGLES: the view (by family / by roll), the role (DPS / Support),
 * the bracelet grade, and the two fight presets. All five are THIS TAB'S OWN
 * state — plain module variables, never persisted, never written into the shared
 * profile. They patch the default profile for the ranking and stop there.
 *
 * NO NETWORK OF ITS OWN. This file opens no connection and reads no character.
