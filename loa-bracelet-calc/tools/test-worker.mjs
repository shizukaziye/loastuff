/**
 * tools/test-worker.mjs — everything about the Worker that can be checked
 * WITHOUT deploying it.
 *
 *   node tools/test-worker.mjs
 *
 * It imports worker/bracelet.js exactly as wrangler's bundler does (ESM entry,
 * pulling the CommonJS model through default-import interop), so the functions
 * under test are the deployed ones, not a copy.
 *
 * What it covers:
 *   1. SCORING PARITY — every character in data/characters.json, re-scored by the
 *      Worker's own score() and compared to the number that character's own entry
 *      recorded, and then to the number the BOARD SUMMARY publishes for it.
 *      Since the summary carries finished scores rather than raw brackets, the
 *      second half is what says the Worker's snapshot builder and its record
 *      scorer are the same arithmetic. Both halves are exact equalities.
 *   2. THE SNAPSHOT — snapshotEntry()/encodeSnapshot() against the same
 *      characters: the row shape, the loadout pick, the better-letter rule for a
 *      support class, and the promise that no raw bracelet is on the wire.
 *   3. THE PAGE PARSER — extractBracelets() against a hand-built fragment in the
 *      exact hydration-blob style, including the raid-then-chaos repeat.
 *   4. THE ROSTER PROOF — collectRosterChars() and ownsCharacter() against the
 *      real roster payload and four older speculative shapes, plus the cases that
 *      must be REFUSED. Since 2026-08-11 this proof guards POST /forget alone; a
 *      LOOKUP needs no sign-in and no ownership (ARCHITECTURE.md §0.3). These
 *      checks stay green either way — they test the walker, not the policy.
 *
 * What it cannot cover, and what a live deploy is for: KV, the rate-limit
 * bindings, CORS stamping, the OAuth round trip, and whether a real character
 * page still matches the parser.
