/**
 * tools/roll-sim.mjs — an INDEPENDENT bracelet simulator.
 *
 *   node tools/roll-sim.mjs [ancient|relic] [slots] [count] [dps|support]
 *
 * Deliberately shares nothing with model/bracelet.js's DP except the per-line
 * damage numbers. It draws granted slots straight from the official weights and
 * plays the seven attempts with a sampled lock threshold, so if the DP is
 * truncating its state space this will say so — a simulator's tail is limited
 * only by how long you run it.
 *
 * MECHANICS (docs/research/mechanics-bible-leaderboard.md):
 *   - three granted slots; four rolls plus three ticket rolls is seven attempts
 *   - one attempt rerolls EVERY unlocked slot as a set; locked lines stay
 *   - a family never appears twice, and at most two basic effects
 *   - both combat-trait places are filled at drop, so a granted slot is basic or
 *     special, renormalised over the excluded trait category
 *   - lock a line worth more than the slot itself is worth with the attempts
 *     remaining: V(n) = E[max(X, V(n-1))], sampled once up front
 *
 * The two combat traits are drawn from Stove's weighted bands.
 *
 * SCORING CAVEAT since model 0.4.x: the DP pools crit, flats and additional
 * damage across the whole set before converting; this simulator still sums
 * line damages. So a DP-vs-simulator comparison now mixes a policy difference
 * with a scoring one, and near the crit cap the simulator reads slightly high.
 * Fine for what it is for — catching a DP whose distribution is impossibly
 * BAD — but do not read small gaps as meaningful.

/**
 * One finished bracelet, in line damage.
 *
 * THE ORDER MATTERS AND IT IS EASY TO GET WRONG. You choose the lock mask BEFORE
 * the roll, on the lines you already have; then every unlocked slot is redrawn as
 * one set; then you keep the old unlocked group or take the new one.
 *
 * Filtering the lines AFTER seeing the draw — the obvious way to write it, and the
 * way loa-gpd's simulator writes it — is locking with hindsight: it cherry-picks a
 * good line out of three fresh ones without having paid a lock for it.
 *
 * Worth about 2 score points on the mean (41.7 against 39.6), so it is a detail
 * rather than a hole. Both orderings still sit BELOW the DP's optimal 45.5,
 * because the threshold rule itself is myopic — hindsight partly compensates for
 * that, which is why the wrong order scores nearer the optimum than the right one.
 *
 * An earlier draft of this comment claimed the gap was fourteen points. That
 * number came from a DP that was itself misconfigured (see score-distribution.md
 * §1) and was never true.
