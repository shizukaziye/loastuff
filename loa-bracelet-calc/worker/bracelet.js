/**
 * worker/bracelet.js — "bracelet-bible", the Cloudflare Worker behind the
 * bracelet calculator's lostark.bible import.
 *
 * Complete as of 2026-08-11: the import round trip, the KV record store, the
 * canonical-default scorer, the queue and its paced drain with a circuit breaker,
 * the long poll, the gzipped leaderboard snapshot, feedback, and the admin
 * surface.
 *
 * ============================== WHY IT EXISTS ==============================
 *
 * `/api/oauth/rosters` is a roster INDEX; it carries no bracelet. The bracelet
 * lives in the SvelteKit hydration blob of a lostark.bible CHARACTER PAGE, and
 * a browser cannot read that page cross-origin (no CORS on the page routes).
 * So this Worker fetches the page server-side, pulls the bracelet out, scores
 * it, and answers JSON with a CORS allowlist for our own origins.
 *
 * ========================= WHO MAY BE LOOKED UP ============================
 *
 * ANYONE, since 2026-08-11. Any visitor, signed in or not, may type any name and
 * region and get that character's bracelet.
 *
 * THAT IS A DELIBERATE POLICY, NOT A HOLE TO PLUG. Shizu holds the lostark.bible
 * relationship, and molenzwiebel's terms are: scraping character pages is
 * permitted at Shizu's discretion, PROVIDED every request carries the
 * authorization token. An earlier build fetched a character only if it appeared
 * on the caller's own /api/oauth/rosters roster — stricter than the permission we
 * actually hold, and chosen only because molenzwiebel means to make roster-only
 * the ONLY path LATER. It is open until he changes the API. Do NOT restore that
 * gate as a bug fix; it is a policy change and it needs Shizu, not a patch. The
 * same decision, dated, is docs/design/ARCHITECTURE.md §0.3.
 *
 * ========================= WHAT DID NOT CHANGE =============================
 *
 * 1. EVERY request to lostark.bible carries an Authorization Bearer. The
 *    CALLER'S OWN token when they are signed in — better attribution, and the
 *    load spreads across users instead of landing entirely on one secret — and
 *    the BIBLE_TOKEN secret otherwise. A tokenless request is the violation, and
 *    is the thing that earns a 429.
 * 2. The token goes to lostark.bible and NOWHERE else, and is never logged and
 *    never stored: the roster cache (which only /forget uses now) is keyed by a
 *    SHA-256 of the token, and the queue holds it in a VALUE that is deleted the
 *    moment the fetch lands.
 * 3. Raid-statistics endpoints are never touched, by any path.
 * 4. The abuse controls are now the ONLY thing between a stranger and Shizu's
 *    token, so every one of them is load-bearing: the per-IP lookup throttle, the
 *    site-wide enqueue gate, the hard cap, the global gate, the ≥3s spacing floor
 *    between character-page fetches, the monthly budget, the fail-streak breaker,
 *    the `nf:` markers and the 7-day cache. There is still no crawler and no
 *    enumeration anywhere in this file: one name, one click, one page.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP IS STILL PROVEN FOR ONE THING. POST /forget DELETES records, so it
 * still checks the caller's own roster holds the character. Reading a public page
 * and deleting someone's row are not the same act.
 *
 * ================================ ROUTES ===================================
 *
 *   OPTIONS *                                   CORS preflight, before the hard cap
 *   GET  /                                      health + model signature
 *   GET  /character?name=&region=[&queue=1][&pos=1][&refresh=1][&publish=0]
 *                                               The one route the import UI calls.
 *                                               No sign-in needed. Cached → answer now.
 *                                               Miss → ENQUEUE and answer
 *                                               {queued, position, total, drainPerMin}.
 *   GET  /bracelet?…                            alias of /character (the name used
 *                                               in docs/design/bible-import-fallback.md)
 *   GET  /wait?region=&name=&since=             Long poll, ≤25s, no sign-in; answers the
 *                                               moment the drain stores a record newer
 *                                               than `since`. Holds only for a lookup
 *                                               that is genuinely pending.
 *   GET  /?list=1   ·   GET /list               the board: the stored gzip bytes, as-is
 *   GET  /status                                is the drain running? (public, cached 30s)
 *   POST /feedback {type,message,contact,hp}    public, honeypotted, throttled, 90-day TTL
 *   POST /import   {characters:[…], publish?}   Bulk queue. Bearer OPTIONAL; a signed-out
 *                                               batch is capped harder (IMPORT_MAX_ANON).
 *   POST /forget   {characters:[…]}|{all:true}  Bearer REQUIRED, roster checked. Removes
 *                                               the caller's OWN characters from the board.
 *   GET  /admin/metrics                         X-Admin-Token. Queue, drain, log, health.
 *   GET  /admin/feedback                        X-Admin-Token. The newest ≤200 notes.
 *   POST /admin/feedback {read|del}             X-Admin-Token.
 *   POST /admin/control  {mode, rate}           X-Admin-Token. run/off/probe, 1–20 a minute.
 *   POST /admin/dequeue  {match|all}            X-Admin-Token. Evict by key substring.
 *   POST /admin/rescore  {}                     X-Admin-Token. Re-score from the raw stats.
 *   POST /admin/seed                            X-Admin-Token. Body = data/characters.json
 *   POST /admin/delete   {region, name}         X-Admin-Token. Takedown.
 *   POST /admin/drain · POST /admin/snapshot    X-Admin-Token. Run one now.
 *                                               /admin/snapshot {full:true} rebuilds
 *                                               every row instead of the dirty ones.
 *   GET  /admin/page?name=&region=              X-Admin-Token. Raw parse probe: what the
 *                                               character page actually yielded. This is how
 *                                               the profile auto-fill map gets filled in
 *                                               without guessing at field names.
 *   cron * * * * *                              drain the queue (paced), then rebuild the
 *                                               snapshot if anything changed
 *
 * EVERY ADMIN MUTATION IS POST. A GET with side effects is one <img src> away from
 * a stranger's page freezing the queue — /admin/drain used to be exactly that.
 *
 * ================================ SCORING ==================================
 *
 * ONE source of truth, no copy: this file `import`s ../model/bracelet.js, which
 * wrangler's esbuild bundles (the model is a UMD that exports CommonJS under
 * Node/bundlers, and pulls ../data/*.js the same way). There is nothing to keep
 * in sync and nothing to verify — if the model changes, redeploying picks it up.
 *
 * Every score stored here is computed at the CANONICAL DEFAULT profile,
 * `normalizeProfile({})`. That is Shizu's rule: the board ranks everyone on the
 * same settings. The calculator tab may score the SAME bracelet on the user's
 * own imported profile; those are two different numbers and the code says which
 * is which. Nothing in this file ever reads a user-supplied profile.
 *
 * ================================ SECRETS ==================================
 *
 * Never in this file — the repo is public. Set with
 *   wrangler secret put <NAME> --config worker/wrangler.toml
 *
 *   BIBLE_TOKEN  the Bearer token lostark.bible's owners issued for this Worker.
 *                It carries the CRON DRAIN, every signed-out lookup, and any
 *                lookup whose caller token turns out to be stale. Live lookups
 *                still PREFER the caller's own token when they have one. Without
 *                this secret a signed-out lookup has no Bearer to send, so it must
 *                not be made at all — fetchCharacterPage refuses.
 *   ADMIN_TOKEN  the admin credential, sent as the `X-Admin-Token` header.
 *                Fail-closed: while unset, nobody is admin.

/**
 * Every `slot:"bracelet"` payload on the page, in document order.
 *
 * WAS WRONG UNTIL 2026-08-11: this used to say the blob repeats the equipment
 * block "raid first, then chaos", and the caller took hit #0 as the raid
 * bracelet. Document order is not fixed — across the 30 saved pages the chaos
 * loadout comes first on 16 of them — so hit #0 was the chaos bracelet about
 * half the time. That is the "wrong bracelet" bug. Use extractLoadouts() below,
 * which reads the loadouts array and knows which bracelet belongs to which tab.
 * This function survives as the last-ditch fallback for a page whose loadouts
 * array cannot be parsed.
 *
 * Parsed by brace-scanning the `data:{…}` object and quoting its bare keys
 * before JSON.parse, the same technique astrogem-bible.js uses for
 * arkGridCores; a flat regex cannot be trusted with an object whose field order
 * is not guaranteed.
 *
 * Known limit: the brace scan would be fooled by a `{` or `}` inside a string
 * value. Nothing in a bracelet payload carries one today (the only strings are
 * `"bracelet"` and the slot name), and a failed parse is skipped rather than
 * crashing the request.

// The LEFT COLUMN — everything the control deck's gear panel holds
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * The calculator's left column is not just item level. It is six honing levels,
 * a necklace additional-damage line, two earring weapon-power lines, one gem
 * level, a 9/7 ability stone and the Master ark-passive node — and every one of
 * them is on the character page, inside the SAME loadout object the bracelet
 * came from. parseCharacterProfile() below reads all of it.
 *
 * Where each field lives, all of it confirmed against 59 saved pages
 * (117 loadouts) rather than assumed:
 *
 *   HONING      items[].data {type:"equipment", honing, advancedHoning}. Six
 *               slots, page names on the left, deck names on the right:
 *               weapon·head·shoulder pass through; upper_body=chest,
 *               lower_body=pants, hand=gloves. `honing` is the exact +N (12…25
 *               across the corpus). `advancedHoning` is the Aegir track and the
 *               deck has no control for it, so it is reported, never applied.
 *
 *   ACCESSORY   items[neck|ear1|ear2].data.stats[]. Accessory stats carry a
 *   LINES       `base` flag; the ROLLED grinding lines are `base:false` (the
 *               bracelet's own stats use `fixed` instead — that is the
 *               structural discriminator between the two). Index 50 on the neck
 *               is Additional Damage and index 152 on an earring is Weapon
 *               Power, both in centi-percent. The corpus holds exactly
 *               {70,160,260} and {80,180,300}, i.e. the deck's own segmented
 *               options 0.7/1.6/2.6 and 0.8/1.8/3 — so the snap below is a
 *               guard, not a routine approximation. Index 49 (crit rate) and
 *               151/124/27/28/34/106 are the other rolled lines; the deck has
 *               no control for them.
 *
 *   GEMS        loadout.gems[] {slot, id, effects[]}. The level is NOT reliably
 *               decodable from the id — the 6503x/6504x families encode it in
 *               digits 6-7 but the 6509x family does not — so read the gem's
 *               attack-power effect instead: {type:2, id:150, value}, in
 *               centi-percent, one per gem. 45→lv6, 60→lv7, 80→lv8, 100→lv9,
 *               120→lv10, checked against the "Lv. N" the page prints. The deck
 *               has ONE gem slider, so the MODAL level is what it gets and the
 *               whole spread rides along in gemLevels[] for the note.
 *
 *   9/7 STONE   items[slot="ability_stone"].data.engravings[] {id, nodes}.
 *               Three engravings, always. "9/7" is the two damage engravings at
 *               9 and 7 nodes, so the toggle goes on when the top two node
 *               counts clear 9 and 7 — a 9/8 or 10/7 stone is a 9/7 or better
 *               and counts.
 *
 *   MASTER      loadout.arkPassive.evolution[] {id, level}. The node ids are
 *               opaque, but the page also RENDERS the same list by name, in the
 *               same order, under its "Evolution" heading — so aligning the two
 *               across all 59 pages names every id. Master is 1032200
 *               (unanimous, 15 of 59 characters have it; its tier-4 neighbours
 *               are 1032100 Critical and 1032300 Pulverize).
 *
 *   ACCESSORY   items[neck|ear1|ear2|finger1|finger2].data.stats[], the
 *   MAIN STAT   `base:true` block this time rather than the rolls. Indices 3, 4
 *               and 5 are Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence and an accessory
 *               carries all three at the SAME value — only the class's own one
 *               counts in game — so index 3 is read and the other two ignored.
 *               Across the 59 pages the five slots land inside the accessory
 *               tool's own bands without exception (neck 15,446–17,857, earring
 *               11,806–13,889, ring 11,001–12,897), and the five sum to the
 *               60–72k the deck's `accessoryMainStat` field holds.
 *
 *   FLAT AP     accessory roll index 124, values {80, 195, 390} across the whole
 *   FLAT WP     corpus — the "Attack Power +N" grinding line. Index 151 is
 *               "Weapon Power +N", values {195, 480, 960}. Both are FLAT, both
 *               are summed over the five accessories, and the two are reported
 *               apart because the model treats them apart: flat attack power
 *               sits outside the square root, flat weapon power inside it.
 *               These are the ACCESSORIES' share alone — see ARK CORE.
 *
 *   ARK CORE    grade and points, never the effect. `arkGridCores[]` carries each
 *               core's id and its four gems' `corePoints`; the id's last digit is
 *               the grade (5 relic, 6 ancient — the only two that ever appear,
 *               and 28 of the corpus's 106 distinct cores appear as both), and
 *               the point sum is what the core's 10 / 17 thresholds key off. What
 *               a core GRANTS is nowhere on the page: no name, no tooltip, no
 *               effect block, and the icon is per slot rather than per core. So
 *               `arkCore` ships {grade, points} for the best core on the board
 *               and the deck sets whether it is an attack core or a weapon core,
 *               which is what turns the pair into flat power. Confirmed the hard
 *               way: reconstruct the page's own weapon-power total from the Serca
 *               table, the earrings, karma and the accessory rolls and the
 *               residual is exactly zero on 65 loadouts — no core weapon power is
 *               in that figure at all.
 *
 *   ATTACK      BUILT, not read: the eleven damage gems plus the ability stone,
 *   POWER %     which are the model's `baseApPct` and its only two sources. Gems
 *               come off their own effect ({type:2, id:150}) — 45/60/80/100/120
 *               is lv6…lv10 at 0.45/0.6/0.8/1.0/1.2% — and the stone pays 1.5%
 *               when its two engraving levels total five or more (see
 *               stoneApPct). A page whose gems cannot be read at all falls back
 *               to eleven level nines rather than to zero.
 *
 *               The page's own `attackPowerMultiplier` is carried through as
 *               `raw.apPctCheck` and agrees to the last decimal on 103 of the 117
 *               corpus loadouts. The other 14 are exactly the pages whose gems
 *               the site could not read either, where it prints the stone alone.
 *
 *   KARMA WP    karma.enlightenment ÷ 10, as a percentage. Derived, not assumed:
 *               take the page's own weapon-power total, divide out the weapon's
 *               Serca value plus every flat weapon-power roll, subtract the two
 *               earrings' weapon-power percentages, and what is left is a
 *               0.1-quantised residual. On the 65 corpus loadouts where nothing
 *               else is unaccounted for, that residual equals enlightenment ÷ 10
 *               on EVERY ONE — 21→2.1%, 26→2.6%, … 30→3.0% — and it is never
 *               below it anywhere. Evolution and Leap do not predict it; only
 *               Enlightenment does. The community's "up to 3%, 2.5% non-whale"
 *               is enlightenment 30 and enlightenment 25.
 *
 *   COMBAT      the page header's estimatedMaxCombatPower.score — NOT the
 *   POWER       `combatPower` on the loadout, which is only what that tab was
 *               wearing when bible last synced it. On 36 of the 59 corpus pages
 *               the ranked loadout's figure is lower, by as much as 5,617, and
 *               on 18 of them the difference moves the gold-per-damage rung the
 *               calculator picks. Noa's chaos tab reads 4,420 against a
 *               character estimate of 6,693 — 1M gold per 1% instead of 3.5M.
 *               The loadout's own figure is kept in raw.loadoutCombatPower, and
 *               raw.combatPowerSource names which of the two was taken.
 *
 * NOT ON THE PAGE, and therefore never emitted:
 *
 *   mainStat / weaponPower as the deck means them — its two override fields are
 *   RAW, before the main-stat and weapon-power percentage buckets. The page
 *   carries battlePoint.parts[0].{mainStat,weaponPower}, which are the TOTALS
 *   after those buckets; handing them over would double-count ~9% and would
 *   flip the override switch that hides the six honing sliders we just filled
 *   exactly. They ride in `raw` under their honest names instead.
 *
 *   critRate / critDamage. lostark.bible prints neither for the character; the
 *   only "Crit Rate" strings on the page belong to accessory and elixir lines.

 * every reader so a table of letters can be drawn, and it grows with the store:
 * the bracelet is ~40% of a row before the loadouts and ~75% after.
 *
 * So the raw payload stays where it already lives, in the c: record, and the row
 * carries what the table shows: the two percentages, the 0–100 grade, the role the
 * board reads a support-class character on, the two combat traits, the effect
 * lines in their decoded form (a family and a tier, not a stat index and a raw
 * value), and — for the >1-bracelet marker alone — a label and a percentage per
 * loadout. Anything that needs the bracelet itself asks GET /character for it.
 *
 * WHICH LOADOUT THE BOARD RANKS. The highest RE-SCORED one, ties to the record's
 * own chosen index — which is the rule the page has always applied to the list it
 * was sent, and it is not pickBestLoadout's (that ranks linesPct first, and it
 * disagrees on 1 of the 67 stored characters). The rule moved; it did not change.
 *
 * A character with fewer than two DISTINCT brackets carries no loadout block at
 * all: the marker only draws on ≥2, so a list that would collapse to one is a
